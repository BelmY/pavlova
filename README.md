Pavlova dispatcher
==================

Given the multitude and variability of online radio receivers, the pavlova dispatcher finds an available receiver slot in the desired area, based on live probing, and redirects your web browser to it, for your listening pleasure.

For now it is mainly aimed to support instances of the [KiwiSDR receiver network](http://sdr.hu/), given their main limitation of 4 user slots maximum. The live probing of available receivers is performed in client-side javascript in your web browser.

"Pavlova" ?

This dispatcher is named after the [pavlova dessert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlova_%28food%29) and draws a bridge between the [KiwiSDR project](http://kiwisdr.com/KiwiSDR/index.html) and [priyom.org](http://priyom.org/).

Feedback
========

The dispatcher rules can be fully customized. If you want to give us feedback about a particular KiwiSDR receiver which you think provides a great reception and deserves a better place, don't hesitate! You can also suggest support for a new area group if you have a use for it.

We think the project could use a little, simple GUI to provide a better experience. If you want to help us, this is welcome!
